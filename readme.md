# Weekly Productive Journal

This repository contains weekly logs of activities, skills, and progress made throughout the year.
Each entry captures personal and professional development, organized by date.

## Structure

- **Yearly Folder**: Top-level directory for each year (e.g., `2025/`)
- **Monthly Folder**: Nested within the year (e.g., `2025/4/` for April)
- **Daily Folder**: Nested within the month with the day as the folder name (e.g., `2025/4/21/`)
- **File**: Each daily folder contains a `dailyProgress.md` with the log for that specific day
- **Assets**: Each daily folder will have an assets directory for resources used in research that day
