# Day of Westward Observation

## thePremier

### westCoastBeauty

This is the starter name for this project/video

#### Video Collection

Reviewed Videos and selected several videos for the project. Decided the videos of choice would be less active videos from the journey to Mt St.Helens

There is a mixture between videos off the gopro and Mavic 3 Pro. The GoPro vids need ot be smoothed.

#### Song Choice

Debating between several classical choices. Something that has a rather constant piano with changes in tempo over time. This allows great clip flow

#### Base Adobe Creative Filter

So far I have landed on 2

SL Gold Orange (gives a lighter feeling to the videos. Issue is the rain makes it act funky)

SL Nuetral Start (This is a really clean filter, but it gives clarity into a sadder ambience. May play good to the tune of natures order)

### pittsburgAdventureSports

#### Video Collection

Collected all the fpv GoPro footage of a fly in pittsburg at an all terain adventure place called adventure sports

#### Song Choice

Struggling a bit with this. Catching vibes of a darker R&B, Jazz, Lounge song. Still Playing around with it

#### Base Adobe Creative Filter

I have landed on SL Blue Cold. It is a harder filter to utilize with a song. It is not an upbeat camera look, so the song has to be far more relaxed, dark, and loung like. Kind of like an Underground jazz vibe with some nice bass guitar vibes
