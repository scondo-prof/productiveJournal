**Project Title:** `pittsburgAdventureSports` (working name)

#### Video Collection

- Compiled FPV GoPro footage from our trip to Pittsburg Adventure Sports, capturing dynamic aerial stunts and course runs.

#### Song Selection

- Considering a laid‑back R\&B/jazz‑lounge track: moody, bass‑driven, and relaxed to match the footage’s kinetic energy.

#### Base Adobe Creative Filter

- **SL Blue Cold**: Cool, subdued palette—pairs well with a lounge‑style track and emphasizes a sophisticated, underground jazz vibe.
