# Day of Westward Observation

## thePremier

### westCoastBeauty

This is the starter name for this project/video

#### Video Collection

Reviewed Videos and selected several videos for the project. Decided the videos of choice would be less active videos from the journey to Mt St.Helens

There is a mixture between videos off the gopro and Mavic 3 Pro. The GoPro vids need ot be smoothed.

#### Song Choice

Debating between several classical choices. Something that has a rather constant piano with changes in tempo over time. This allows great clip flow

#### Base Adobe Creative Filter

So far I have landed on 2

SL Gold Orange (gives a lighter feeling to the videos. Issue is the rain makes it act funky)

SL Nuetral Start (This is a really clean filter, but it gives clarity into a sadder ambience. May play good to the tune of natures order)
