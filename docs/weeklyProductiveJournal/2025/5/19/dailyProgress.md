#### Music Selection

- Explored noir‑style jazz tracks with dark, groovy basslines and moderate tempo—perfect for an urban‑adventure vibe.

## Tickling the Ivories, Not the Ovaries

### Song Practice & Learning

#### “II” by Old Gray

- Confidently play through all measures; minor chord slips in a few spots
- Focus: smooth chord changes and consistent finger placement.

#### “I” by Old Gray

- Experimenting with dynamics: varying strike intensity to convey different emotions.
- Next goal: refine crescendos and decrescendos for more expressive phrasing.

#### Transition: “II” → “I”

- Designing a seamless segue from “II” into “I.” The titles may seem reversed, but I enjoy ending on “I” to underscore a poignant, sorrow‑tinged finale.

#### “Theme from Halloween” (Michael Myers Theme)

- Intro: right‑hand only first four measures. Pattern throughout whole song is:
  `Ring Finger Thumb Thumb Ring Finger Thumb Thumb Ring Finger Thumb Pinky Thumb (one measure)`
- Then the left hand enters with sustained whole‑note bass tones. Pattern throughout whole song:

  1. `Ring finger (one measure)`
  2. `Thumb (one measure)`
  3. `Pinky (two measures)`

- Challenge: maintain this rapid alternation at high tempo without sacrificing accuracy.
