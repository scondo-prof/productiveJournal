# Day of Slapping Pavement and Semibreves

## Spraying Albuterol and Acquiring Stamina

### Outdoor Run

- Completed an outdoor route of approximately 2 miles
- Maintained full-leg extensions and an open running posture
- Took five short breaks to catch my breath and refine form
- Closed the session with a powerful all-out sprint, leaving me breathless in the best way

## Tickling the Ivories, Not the Ovaries

### "I" by Old Gray

- Confidently played through the entire piece at tempo
- Focused on dynamic key strikes to convey the song’s emotional peaks and valleys

### "II" by Old Gray

- Nailed the first ten measures with consistency
- Encountering difficulty in measures 11–16 where the left-hand pattern shifts and the right hand leaps across notes on the pointer, middle, and ring fingers
- Next steps:

  1. Practice hands-separately at 60% speed
  2. Use a metronome to gradually increase tempo
  3. Reinforce muscle memory with repeated, targeted drills

### Michael Myers’ Theme

- Learned the initial chord progression cleanly
- Struggle Point: the rapid hand movements and wide stretches in the measure shown below
- Strategy:

  1. Isolate the challenging measure
  2. Play slowly with a metronome set to a manageable tempo
  3. Gradually ramp up speed by 5% increments, focusing on precision before tempo

## Feelin the Felt

### Stroke Practice

#### Genie in a Bottle

I refined my cue stroke by practicing against the tip of a water bottle, reinforcing techniques I outlined in my [Genie in a Bottle journal entry](https://scondo-prof.github.io/productiveJournal/weeklyProductiveJournal/2025/5/06/dailyProgress/#genie-in-a-bottle). This exercise helped me keep a straight follow‑through and consistent bridge pressure.

I also experimented with two challenging bridge positions:

- **Rail Bridge (Hanging Off the Table):** Simulated shots where the cue ball hugs the rail. This forced me to stabilize my wrist and maintain a level cue to avoid miscuing.
- **Arched Bridge (Shooting Behind an Object):** Practiced shots where I must clear an obstruction. The elevated bridge improved my accuracy and taught me to trust the cue’s contact point when reaching over.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Maintaining a solid, level bridge is essential when the cue ball is near the rail.
2. An arched bridge demands extra wrist stability and precise aiming—visualizing the cue ball’s path is critical.
3. Consistent follow‑through, verified by the water bottle drill, ensures repeatable accuracy across any bridge.
