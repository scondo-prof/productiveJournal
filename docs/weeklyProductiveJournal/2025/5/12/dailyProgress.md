# Day of Docs and Docile Night Skies

## Spraying Albuterol and Acquiring Stamina

### Treadmill Tempo Test

Today I hit the treadmill to dial in my pace—1.5 miles at 5.5 mph. Based on how that felt, I’ll transition future runs to the great outdoors.

## Bend Around Higby Mountain

### The Video Smoother

I wrapped up editing the “Bend Around Higby Mountain” footage, then leveraged our `s3_upload.py` utility to push all Premiere project assets to S3. You can review the upload function directly in the journal: [s3_upload.py](https://scondo-prof.github.io/productiveJournal/weeklyProductiveJournal/2025/5/01/dailyProgress/#s3_uploadpy).

Once the files were in place, I pulled them down onto my **Video Smoother** workstation and kicked off the render/export pipeline. The machine churned through the frames while I monitored resource utilization—no hiccups.

**Next Steps:**

- Schedule the final upload to YouTube at 7:30 AM EST on May 13, 2025.
