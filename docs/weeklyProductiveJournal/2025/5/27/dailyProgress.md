# Day of the Pheonix

## The Premiere

### Venture to Mount St.Helens

#### Rendering and Produce

The export of the Adventure Sports FPV flight ended up lagging within the youtube browser but not on local. It might have something to do with how dense it was with frames and quality. Attempted to utilize the youtube 4k preset. But it did not work as intended. It ended up exporting in 2k lopping off a bunch of video quality. Attempting to match source (uhd) but turn down frame rate from 120 to 50fps
