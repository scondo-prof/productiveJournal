# Day of the Pheonix

## The Premiere

### Venture to Mount St.Helens

#### Rendering and Produce

The export of the Adventure Sports FPV flight ended up lagging within the youtube browser but not on local. It might have something to do with how dense it was with frames and quality. Attempted to utilize the youtube 4k preset. But it did not work as intended. It ended up exporting in 2k lopping off a bunch of video quality. Attempting to match source (uhd) but turn down frame rate from 120 to 50fps

## Git Lab

### Git Lab Via SSH

#### Authentication

It is important to know if you are connecting to a Git Lab environment that lives somewhere private that must be accessed via a vpn tunnel there are some steps to auth. First Know you must have the VPN active. Second, if you decide to connect via SSH key, know you cannot test your ssh connection with a generic gitlab lookup. Due to the fact it is its own private entity it can only know the resources in the entity. Test by cloning a repo that is accessible in the gitlab
