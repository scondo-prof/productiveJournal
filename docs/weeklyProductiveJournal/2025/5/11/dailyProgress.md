# Day of The River of Light

## The Premier

### Nightway Between Mt Higby

#### Target Vibe

It is a stationary shot that watches a highway as it wraps around Mt Higby as the sun sets. As the sunsets it emphasizes the flow of traffic. It will be a large stationary shot simply watching the nights pressence become strong.

#### Speed

Looking like a clip speed of 180% seems like a speed that isnt unrealistically fast, yet carries the passing of time in a mere six minutes.

#### Lumitri Settings
