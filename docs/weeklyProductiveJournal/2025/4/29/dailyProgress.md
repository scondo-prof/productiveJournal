### Determining the Process of Thinking

#### Terminology Strong Memory

- The Memory Process of easily retaining information strictly by word of mouth, or text on a sheet
- Found a lot of successful Hard Science Students such as Physics, Bio, Chemistry, Math have this type of memory
- Example of this would be hearing someone introduce their name as susan and easily remembering susan without any additional mental computation

#### Image/Process Strong Memory

- The memory process of seeing images/processes for understanding(very diagram heavy)
- Found A lot of Engineers with Infrastructure/Processess Diagramming have this type of memory
- Example of this would be hearing someone introduce their name as susan, the brain will forget susan unless it is tied in to a physical subject that the host already understands, such as tying susan in with the Main character from Monsters Versus Aliens
