# Day of Understanding The Process of Cranial Computation

## Learning Styles

### Determining the Process of Thinking

#### Terminology Strong Memory

- The Memory Process of easily retaining information strictly by word of mouth, or text on a sheet
- Found a lot of successful Hard Science Students such as Physics, Bio, Chemistry, Math have this type of memory
- Example of this would be hearing someone introduce their name as susan and easily remembering susan without any additional mental computation

#### Image/Process Strong Memory

- The memory process of seeing images/processes for understanding(very diagram heavy)
- Found A lot of Engineers with Infrastructure/Processess Diagramming have this type of memory
- Example of this would be hearing someone introduce their name as susan, the brain will forget susan unless it is tied in to a physical subject that the host already understands, such as tying susan in with the Main character from Monsters Versus Aliens

### CIDR Blocks

#### Understanding Ranges

- Cidr Blocks are made up of 32 bits

- Each Octet is made up of 8 bits

- This means if the cidr block is /8 there are 3 octets that are mutable

  - 10.0.0.0/8 (all 0s are mutable to be any value between 0 and 255 while the 10 is fixed)

- Total amount of IP address for each full octet would be as follows 256^n

  - where n is a number dependent on the amount of octets mutable /24 1 octet is mutable so value would be n meaning 256 free addresses, while /16 n would be 2 because 2 octets are mutable so n is 2 meaning 65,536 free addresses
