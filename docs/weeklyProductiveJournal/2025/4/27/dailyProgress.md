# Day of Organization, and Data Reckoning

## Productive Journal Repo

### Directory Structure

- Modfied Directory Structure to also include dnd notes
  - Entries are located with the same directory structure as weeklyProductiveJournal entries, but reside in the dndJournal Directory

### Github Pages Integration

- The repo was starting to get populated, and it needed an ability to organize beyond a single readme.md

  - Solution was to integrate a CI/CD pipeline I have used before to create repo docs utilizing Github Pages

- Went through many interations of the Github Pages Layout, and landed on the current structure that is located in the mkdocs.yaml file in the root of this repo
